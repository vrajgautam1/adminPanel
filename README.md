# ReactJS Product Management App (CRUD)

This is a simple CRUD app built with **ReactJS** to demonstrate my ability to use **Axios** for fetching, sending, updating, and deleting data via API calls.

## What It Does

- Lets a user:
  - **Add** new products
  - **View** products in a table
  - **Edit** existing products
  - **Delete** products

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS** for UI
- **Axios** for API requests
- **json-server** as a mock backend (`db.json` file used as database)
- **Bootstrap template** for styling

## Why This Exists

To show I know how to:
- Use Axios in real-world scenarios
- Handle CRUD operations cleanly in a React app
- Integrate a frontend with a mock API
